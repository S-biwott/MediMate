MediMate – AI Health Buddy

MediMate is a lightweight, AI-powered health assistant designed to provide general health information, navigation to clinics, and support for underserved communities.
⚠️ Disclaimer: MediMate provides general health information only. It does not replace medical advice. In emergencies, always call your local emergency number.

🚀 How the System Works

MediMate connects Glide, Google Sheets, Make.com, and Hugging Face API to provide an interactive and user-friendly health buddy app:

1. Glide (Frontend App Builder)

Glide is used to create the app interface without coding.

Users interact with MediMate through a mobile-friendly chat screen and navigation menus.

Glide pulls in data from Google Sheets and displays responses generated by Hugging Face.

2. Google Sheets (Database/Backend)

Acts as a lightweight database for storing user input, chatbot history, and clinic locations.

Glide is automatically synced with Google Sheets for real-time updates.

Example: When a user enters a health question, their message is logged in Google Sheets.

3. Hugging Face (AI Model / NLP Engine)

Provides the AI-powered responses to user queries.

A Make.com scenario sends the user’s text from Google Sheets → Hugging Face API → Returns an AI-generated answer.

Hugging Face ensures MediMate can process natural language questions (e.g., “What should I do for a headache?”) and respond with safe, scoped answers.

4. Make.com (Automation / Orchestration)

Acts as the glue connecting Glide, Google Sheets, and Hugging Face.

Workflow:

New user message appears in Google Sheets.

Make.com picks up the new row.

Sends the message to Hugging Face API.

Gets response → writes it back into Google Sheets.

Glide automatically updates and shows the AI’s response in the app.

Make.com also handles red-flag conditions (e.g., chest pain → trigger “urgent care” message).

📱 How MediMate Works (User Flow)

User opens the app on mobile/desktop (Glide frontend).

They type a health-related question (e.g., “What should I eat for a stomach ache?”).

The question is saved in Google Sheets.

Make.com workflow sends the question to Hugging Face API.

Hugging Face AI generates a safe, general health response.

Make.com writes the response back to Google Sheets.

Glide updates instantly, showing the AI reply in the chat interface.

If red-flag symptoms are detected, the app shows a warning and suggests finding a clinic immediately.

🛡️ Guardrails

Only provides general health information (no diagnosis).

Always shows a disclaimer banner.

Red-flag symptoms trigger urgent care instructions + “Find a Clinic” screen.
